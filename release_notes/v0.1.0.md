# PyWiki v0.1.0 — Release Notes

**Released:** 2026-02-27

This is the first public release of PyWiki — a fast, modern wiki platform built with
FastAPI and Python, inspired by MediaWiki.

---

## What's New

### Three markup formats

PyWiki supports three content formats, selectable per page:

| Format | Syntax | Rendered by |
|---|---|---|
| **Markdown** | `# Heading`, `**bold**`, `[[WikiLink]]` | mistune 3 |
| **reStructuredText** | `.. directive::`, `*italic*` | docutils |
| **Wikitext** | `= Heading =`, `'''bold'''`, `[[WikiLink]]` | Built-in renderer |

Wikitext support means pages copied directly from MediaWiki will render correctly
without conversion.

### Versioned pages

Every save creates a new version — nothing is ever overwritten. You can:

- Browse the full history of any page
- View a unified diff between any two versions
- Read any historical version by appending `?version=N` to the URL

### Namespaces

Pages are organised into namespaces (similar to MediaWiki namespaces). A default
**Main** namespace is created automatically on first run. Admins can create additional
namespaces, each with its own default content format.

### Recent Changes

A dedicated `/recent` page lists the most recently edited pages across all namespaces,
filterable by namespace and count. The home page also shows a 10-item summary.

### REST API

A full REST API is available at `/api/v1`:

- Authentication (register, login, token refresh)
- Namespace management
- Page CRUD, history, diff, search
- File attachments
- Live-preview rendering endpoint
- Admin stats and user management

Interactive docs: `/api/docs` (Swagger UI) · `/api/redoc`

### File attachments

Upload files to any page via the API. Attachments are stored on the filesystem with
metadata tracked in the database.

### JWT authentication with transparent refresh

Sessions use short-lived access tokens (8 hours) backed by long-lived refresh tokens
(30 days). Expired access tokens are renewed automatically on the next page request —
users are not logged out until their refresh token expires.

## Upgrading

This is the initial release — no migration is needed. Run:

```bash
pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The database and default namespace are created automatically on first startup.

---

## Known Limitations

- Search uses `ILIKE` (substring match) — no full-text ranking or stemming yet
- Wikitext renderer covers common syntax; advanced features (tables, `<ref>`, `<gallery>`)
  are not yet supported
- No email verification or password reset flow
- Single-file SQLite database (PostgreSQL support planned)

See [`TODO.md`](../../TODO.md) for the full feature backlog.
